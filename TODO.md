# TODO: Implement Intelligent Agent Simulation

## Per-Task Process
For each task, follow this process to ensure high quality:
1. Plan: Outline the specific steps and components needed.
2. Implement: Write the code, focusing on clarity and modularity.
3. Test: Create and run unit tests for the implemented functionality.
4. Review: Perform a self-review of the code, ensuring it meets project standards.
5. Refactor: Optimize and improve the code based on the review.
6. Document: Add clear comments and update any relevant documentation.

## Task List

- [ ] Implement basic canvas setup and rendering loop

### 4. Design and Implement Agent System
- [ ] Create `types/Agent.ts` for agent type definitions
- [ ] Create `components/Agent.tsx` for individual agent rendering
- [ ] Implement `hooks/useAgent.ts` for agent state and behavior

### 5. Implement Environment
- [ ] Create `types/Environment.ts` for environment type definitions
- [ ] Create `components/Environment.tsx` for environment rendering
- [ ] Implement `hooks/useEnvironment.ts` for environment state and interactions

### 6. Implement Intelligence Measurement System
- [ ] Create `utils/intelligenceMeasurement.ts` for intelligence calculation functions
- [ ] Implement functions for each variable (ΔE_sys, ΔS_sys, ΔI_sys, ΔC_sys, ΔG_sys, L_sys)
- [ ] Create `hooks/useIntelligenceMeasurement.ts` for real-time intelligence tracking

### 7. Implement Learning/Evolution System
- [ ] Create `utils/learning.ts` for learning algorithms
- [ ] Create `utils/evolution.ts` for evolutionary algorithms
- [ ] Implement `hooks/useLearning.ts` and `hooks/useEvolution.ts` for agent adaptation

### 8. Develop Simulation Control System
- [ ] Create `components/SimulationControls.tsx` for user interface controls
- [ ] Implement `hooks/useSimulationControl.ts` for managing simulation state

### 9. Implement Data Visualization
- [ ] Create `components/IntelligenceGraph.tsx` for displaying intelligence metrics
- [ ] Implement `hooks/useDataVisualization.ts` for managing visualization data

### 10. Integrate All Components
- [ ] Update `App.tsx` to include all created components
- [ ] Ensure proper data flow between components using React hooks

### 11. Implement Advanced Features
- [ ] Create `utils/complexityAnalysis.ts` for analyzing agent strategies
- [ ] Implement `hooks/useComplexityAnalysis.ts` for real-time complexity assessment
- [ ] Create `utils/informationProcessing.ts` for advanced information handling
- [ ] Implement `hooks/useInformationProcessing.ts` for managing information flow

### 12. Optimize Performance
- [ ] Review and optimize render cycles
- [ ] Implement efficient data structures for agent and environment management
- [ ] Use React.memo and useMemo where appropriate to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### 13. Add User Interaction Features
- [ ] Implement ability to modify environment parameters
- [ ] Add feature to select and inspect individual agents

### 14. Implement Saving and Loading
- [ ] Create `utils/stateManagement.ts` for saving/loading simulation states
- [ ] Implement `hooks/useStateManagement.ts` for managing save/load functionality

### 15. Write Tests
- [ ] Create test files for each component, hook, and utility function
- [ ] Implement comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Create integration tests for key simulation processes

### 16. Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with project overview and setup instructions
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for contributors
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all functions and components

### 17. Final Review and Refactoring
- [ ] Conduct a full code review
- [ ] Refactor code based on review findings
- [ ] Ensure all files adhere to the 80-line limit
- [ ] Verify proper use of React hooks throughout the project

### 18. Prepare for Deployment
- [ ] Set up build process
- [ ] Test built version of the application
- [ ] Create deployment documentation

This task list provides a structured approach to implementing the intelligent agent simulation, focusing on creating smaller, more manageable files and leveraging React hooks for functionality. Each task should be approached using the per-task process outlined at the beginning to ensure high-quality implementation.
